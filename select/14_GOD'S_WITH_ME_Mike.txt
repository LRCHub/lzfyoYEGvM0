Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, uhh
Thoughts of my past that just won't leave
Lost in this path on my only
Stress and depression cost a pack of the OG
Why I'm in a pack full of lonely?
When wolves cry, don't hurt me
When wolves cry, don't hurt me
I was in the rain, in the sleet, to the dirt
Yeah, your man was in the back, silent 'til the nigga heard me
'Til the nigga heard me
Did it all for y'all, why y'all niggas tryna hurt me?
I peep the structure when the birds flee
I peep destruction in discussion over earl tea
Mama say, "You a jewel, let your pearls bleed"
Drama stay in a loop when you thirsty
I been hungry
Still ain't go uptown, I ain't call auntie
Maybe when I touch down, nah, it's been a long week
Always on my hand like a pick to guitar strings
I ain't seen bliss, it's been a long ting
I'm too busy tripping 'ddicted to the wrong things
When you walking and you going, you can fall deep
Smoking spliffs on the roof, sun's arm's reach
Promise papa I'mma call, I'm sorry
Promise papa I'mma call,
I'm sorry (I'm mad sorry, I'm telling you I'mma call you pretty soon)
Yuh, yuh, uhh, uhh (I promise you, I'll get to you soon)

Niggas want me six feet down when I'm six feet above
Play the back while my niggas play the front
Play the back while y'all niggas play the front
I play the back while y'all niggas play the-
Niggas want me six feet down when I'm six feet above
I play the back while my niggas play the front
I play the back while my niggas play the front
I play the, ay
Niggas want me six feet down when I'm six feet above
I play the back while y'all niggas play the front
I play the back while y'all niggas play the front
I play the back while y'all niggas play
Want me six feet down when I'm six feet above
