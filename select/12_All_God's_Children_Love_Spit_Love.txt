All god's children
Come to harm
There's no good reason for alarm
Let them play
There's always blue skies follow rain
The sun will always shine again
So they say
I see little girls down below
Singing summer songs
There's a shadow where there was a sun
Now the summer's gone
The sky is raining at my back
And all my dreams got painted black
I want them back
I see little girls down below
Singing summer songs
There's a shadow where there was a sun
Now the summer's gone
I speak too much
Yeah yeah
I talk too much yeah
I think too much
Yeah yeah
I talk too much
Yeah
There's always blue skies follow rain
The sun will always shine again
So they say
I see little girls down below
Singing summer songs
There's a shadow where there was a sun
Now that summer's gone
I speak too much
Yeah yeah
I talk too much
Yeah
I think too much
Yeah yeah
I talk too much yeah
I speak too much
I talk too much
I think too much
I talk too much
